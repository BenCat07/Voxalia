### What's the goal in Voxalia?

- Whatever you want it to be! You can go for:
	- The biggest / strongest base!
	- The coolest build!
	- The strongest character gear!
	- Completion of all the available story lines!

### Did you say "story lines"?

- Yes! The game will have a primary story line to play through, and potentially more.
- But also, the game is open to modding - even the official storyline will be made in mod code to ensure the modding system is capable!

### How far along is the game?

- It's still in early dev! We haven't even reached what we'd consider alpha yet.

### Where can I get Voxalia?

- Take to us! Check the contact page on the FreneticXYZ official website, and join us on IRC or Discord to get involved!
- In the future, you'll be able to get the game without having to go through people, we have it this way only in early development.

### How do I get started once I have the game?

- Once you have a valid FreneticXYZ account and a copy of the game, open the Launcher and login.
- One day you'll be able to click a singleplayer button in the main menu and start up a story, but for now...
	- run singleplayer.bat or .sh depending on your OS, and mess about in the sandbox environment.

### How does Voxalia compare to similar games?

- We've got better graphics than most (optionally, there's also a less pretty 'fast' render mode).
- We use better/more-modern tech than most (OpenGL 4.3 for example, or C# as the primary language).
- We have more complex/fun survival situations than most:
	- You not only can build bases, you can fully interact with the terrain and build a base even where there was ground before (Similar to Minecraft).
	- You can do really cool and fancy things, like place automated powered turrets (Similar to ARK).
	- There's a lot of things to watch out for (enemies of various type, hunger, thirst, etc.) but difficulty sliders are available to make it fun for everyone!
- More moddable than most:
	- We have fully open source backing code!
	- We have a full native C# plugin engine and API.
	- We have a full script engine and API.
- More space than most:
	- Worlds are nearly unlimited in size!
	- Can have multiple worlds in a single game instance.
	- An entire galaxy's worth of servers will be available if plans go well.
- More user friendly than most:
	- Want to open up a server to play with friends? Just run the server program, it does everything for you - even portforwarding (or at least it tries to where available)!
	- Full control over most options, and scripting available where you need something more advanced!

### What is FreneticScript?

- A powerful and cleverly written command/tag syntax script engine, that can be used to mod Voxalia.

### No, what is FreneticScript *really*?

- A drunken misinterpretation of a beginner's tutorial to Visual Basic.

### What is FreneticDataSyntax

- A simple yet powerful method of storing data and configuration values in a human-readable format.

### No, what is FreneticDataSyntax *really?

- A drunken mistranslation of a YAML specification written in a foreign language.

### What is FreneticXYZ?

- Our company! It's not yet registered but will be soon!

### No, what is FreneticXYZ *really*?

- A drunken misunderstanding of government guidelines.
