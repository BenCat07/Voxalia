WARNING: This license is not yet fully reviewed and complete!
AS SUCH: we do not recommend using it!
FURTHER: for this specific version of the license,
if a future version of this license exists within reasonable
access, it is assumed to supersede this license, even for this
older copy of the Software (as defined below) containing this
early notice.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any and all persons
or parties obtaining a copy of this software (IE code and any associated
documentation files, the "Software"), to deal in the Software with
minimal restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,
copy, modify, merge, publish, and/or distribute copies of the Software,
and to permit any parties or persons to whom the Software is distributed
to do so, subject to the following conditions:

A: The Software, or any substantial portion of the Software
shall not be sold, sub-licensed, or relicensed by any person or party other
than that which is named by the copyright notice above (the "Software Owner"),
as denoted by the "Copyright (C) yyyy" prefix.
The software may additionally be sold or sub-licensed (but not relicensed)
by any person or party permitted to do so by the Software Owner,
as granted at the Software Owner's discretion. Further, the Software Owner
may permit, at the Softwar Owner's discretion, any seller of the Software
to themselves grant this special right to other persons or parties.

B: Any relicensing of the software is to be done and handled at the
Software Owner's own discretion and control.
No party, whether external or internal to the Software Owner's party,
shall restrict or induce this action in any way, excluding through
an official declaration from the Software Owner's party in and of
itself. (EG in the case of a single person, that person alone may perform
this action).

C: Any portions of the Software not written or created by the Software Owner,
but distributed with this license and same copyright holding notice,
shall be considered copyright to the Software Owner,
under the terms of this license, including all notices and final remarks.

D: The above copyright notice, any associated warnings and notices,
the titling for this license, and this permission notice shall all be
included in full unmodified form in all copies or substantial portions of
the Software.

E: Portions of the Software imported from elsewhere, as denoted by them
containing their own license notice within reasonable availability,
shall be considered to be primarily licensed under the license included
with said portion. HOWEVER, any usage of that portion of the software
must be kept within the terms of this license if acquired from
within this Software's distributions. To use any external software or
software portion fully and solely within its own license,
acquire that software or software portion from original distributions
dedicated to that software or software portion, or distributions that
license that software or software portion under terms that do not contain
this notice or a similar notice.
The above applies in particular to cases in which the software or
software portion in question have been modified beyond original form.

NOTE: In specific terms, one can generally safely copy less
than one file's worth of code without it being considered substantial.
Any amounts higher than that can be decided at the Software Owner's
discretion or a court's decisions. If uncertain, contact the
Software Owner first where possible.
